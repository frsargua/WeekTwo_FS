I created a wireframe as a guide for my html and css.

To reduce the number of bugs, each component of the website was created separately and combined at the end.

The css was built along side each component. Making it easier to arrange construct.

Extra:

I used a HACK to make the navbar expandible without JavaScript. I achieved this by using an input tag (with type = checkbox and display=none) and a label with an img tag as a child to add the emoji.
